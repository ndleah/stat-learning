In this lab, we explore the resampling techniques covered in this chapter. Some of the commands in this lab may take a while to run on your computer.

## The Validation Set Approach

We explore the use of the validation set approach in order to estimate the test error rates that result from fitting various linear models on the `Auto` data set.

Before we begin, we use the `set.seed()` function in order to set a  for `R`'s random number generator. It is generally a good idea to set a random seed when performing an analysis such as cross-validation that contains an element of randomness, so that the results obtained can be reproduced precisely at a later time.

We begin by using the `sample()` function to split the set of observations into two halves, by selecting a random subset of $196$ observations out of the original $392$ observations. We refer to these observations as the training set.

```{r chunk1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ISLR2)
set.seed(1)
train <- sample(392, 196)
```

We then use the `subset` option in `lm()` to fit a linear regression using only the observations corresponding to the training set.

```{r chunk2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto, subset = train)
```

We now use the `predict()` function to estimate the response for all $392$ observations, and we use the `mean()` function to calculate the MSE of the $196$ observations in the validation set. Note that the `-train` index below selects  only the observations that are not in the training set.

```{r chunk3}
attach(Auto)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit, Auto))[-train]^2)
```

Therefore, the estimated test MSE for the linear regression fit is $23.27$. We can use the `poly()` function to estimate the test error for the quadratic and cubic regressions.

```{r chunk4}
lm.fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2), data = Auto, 
    subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit2, Auto))[-train]^2)
lm.fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 3), data = Auto, 
    subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit3, Auto))[-train]^2)
```

These error rates are $18.72$ and $18.79$, respectively. If we choose a different training set instead, then we will obtain somewhat different errors on the validation set.

```{r chunk5}
set.seed(2)
train <- sample(392, 196)
lm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit, Auto))[-train]^2)
lm.fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2), data = Auto, 
    subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit2, Auto))[-train]^2)
lm.fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 3), data = Auto, 
    subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit3, Auto))[-train]^2)
```

Using this split of the observations into a training set and a validation set, we find that the validation set error rates for the models with linear, quadratic, and cubic terms are $25.73$, $20.43$, and $20.39$, respectively.

These results are consistent with our previous findings: a model that predicts `mpg` using a quadratic function of `horsepower` performs better than a model that involves only a linear function of `horsepower`, and there is little evidence in favor of a model that uses a cubic function of `horsepower`.

## Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

The LOOCV estimate can be automatically computed for any generalized linear model using the `glm()` and `cv.glm()` functions. In the lab of previous section, we used the `glm()` function to perform logistic regression by passing in the `family = "binomial"` argument. But if we use `glm()` to fit a model without passing in the `family` argument, then it  performs linear regression, just like the `lm()` function.
 
In this lab, we will perform linear regression using the `glm()` function rather than the `lm()` function because the former can be used together with `cv.glm()`. The `cv.glm()` function is part of the `boot` library.

```{r chunk8}
library(boot)
glm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
cv.err <- cv.glm(Auto, glm.fit)
cv.err$delta
```

The `cv.glm()` function produces a list with several components. The two numbers in the `delta` vector contain the cross-validation results. In this case the numbers are identical (up to two decimal places) and correspond to the LOOCV statistic. Below, we discuss a situation in which the two numbers differ. Our cross-validation estimate for the test error is approximately $24.23$.

We can repeat this procedure for increasingly complex polynomial fits. To automate the process, we use the `for()` function to initiate a which iteratively fits polynomial regressions for polynomials of order $i=1$ to $i=10$, computes the associated cross-validation error, and stores it in the $i$th element of the vector `cv.error`.

```{r chunk9}
cv.error <- rep(0, 10)
for (i in 1:10) {
  glm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = Auto)
  cv.error[i] <- cv.glm(Auto, glm.fit)$delta[1]
}
cv.error
```

## $k$-Fold Cross-Validation

The `cv.glm()` function can also be used to implement $k$-fold CV. Below we use $k=10$, a common choice for $k$, on the `Auto` data set.

We once again set a random seed and initialize a vector in which we will store the CV errors corresponding to the polynomial fits of orders one to ten.

```{r chunk10}
set.seed(17)
cv.error.10 <- rep(0, 10)
for (i in 1:10) {
  glm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = Auto)
  cv.error.10[i] <- cv.glm(Auto, glm.fit, K = 10)$delta[1]
}
cv.error.10
```

Notice that the computation time is shorter than that of LOOCV. We still see little evidence that using cubic or higher-order polynomial terms leads to lower test error than simply using a quadratic fit.

## The Bootstrap

We illustrate the use of the bootstrap on the `Auto` data set.

\subsubsection{Estimating the Accuracy of a Statistic of Interest}

One of the great advantages of the bootstrap approach is that it can be
applied in almost all situations. No complicated mathematical calculations
are required. Performing a bootstrap analysis in `R` entails only two
steps. First, we must create a function that computes the statistic of
interest. Second, we use the `boot()` function, which is part of the `boot` library, to perform the bootstrap by repeatedly
sampling observations from the data set with replacement.

The `Portfolio` data set in the `ISLR2` package is simulated data of $100$ pairs of returns. To illustrate the use of the bootstrap on this data, we must first
create a function, `alpha.fn()`, which takes as input the $(X,Y)$ data
as well as a vector indicating which observations should be used to
estimate $\alpha$. The function then outputs the estimate for $\alpha$
based on the selected observations.

```{r chunk11}
alpha.fn <- function(data, index) {
  X <- data$X[index]
  Y <- data$Y[index]
  (var(Y) - cov(X, Y)) / (var(X) + var(Y) - 2 * cov(X, Y))
}
```

This function *returns*, or outputs, an estimate for $\alpha$ to the observations indexed by the argument `index`. For instance, the following command tells `R` to estimate $\alpha$ using
all $100$ observations.

```{r chunk12}
alpha.fn(Portfolio, 1:100)
```

The next command uses the `sample()` function to randomly select $100$ observations from the range $1$ to $100$, with replacement. This is equivalent
to constructing a new bootstrap data set and recomputing $\hat{\alpha}$ based on the new data set.

```{r chunk13}
set.seed(7)
alpha.fn(Portfolio, sample(100, 100, replace = T))
```

We can implement a bootstrap analysis by performing this command many times, recording all of the corresponding estimates for $\alpha$, and computing the resulting standard deviation.

However, the `boot()` function automates this approach. Below we produce $R=1,000$ bootstrap estimates for $\alpha$.


```{r chunk14}
boot(Portfolio, alpha.fn, R = 1000)
```

The final output shows that using the original data, $\hat{\alpha}=0.5758$,
and that the bootstrap estimate for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\alpha})$ is $0.0897$.

\subsubsection{Estimating the Accuracy of a Linear Regression Model}

The bootstrap approach can be used  to assess the variability of the coefficient estimates and predictions from a statistical learning method. Here we use the bootstrap approach in order to assess the variability of the estimates for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, the intercept and slope terms for the linear regression model that uses  `horsepower` to predict `mpg` in the `Auto` data set. We will compare the estimates obtained using the bootstrap to those obtained using the formulas for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)$ and ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)$.

We first create a simple function, `boot.fn()`, which takes in the `Auto` data set as well as a set of indices for the observations, and returns the intercept and slope estimates for the linear regression model. We then apply this function to the full set of $392$ observations in order to compute the estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ on the entire data set.

```{r chunk15}
boot.fn <- function(data, index)
  coef(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = data, subset = index))
boot.fn(Auto, 1:392)
```

The `boot.fn()` function can also be used in order to create bootstrap estimates for the intercept and slope terms by randomly sampling from among the observations with replacement. Here we give two examples.

```{r chunk16}
set.seed(1)
boot.fn(Auto, sample(392, 392, replace = T))
boot.fn(Auto, sample(392, 392, replace = T))
```

Next, we use the `boot()` function to compute the standard errors of $1,000$ bootstrap estimates for the intercept and slope terms.

```{r chunk17}
boot(Auto, boot.fn, 1000)
```

This indicates that the bootstrap estimate for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)$ is $0.84$, and that the bootstrap estimate for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)$ is $0.0073$.

Below we compute the bootstrap standard error estimates and the standard linear regression estimates that result from fitting the quadratic model to the data. Since this model provides a good fit to the data, there is now a better correspondence between the bootstrap estimates and the standard estimates of ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)$, ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)$ and ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)$.

```{r chunk19}
boot.fn <- function(data, index)
  coef(
      lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), 
        data = data, subset = index)
    )
set.seed(1)
boot(Auto, boot.fn, 1000)
summary(
    lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), data = Auto)
  )$coef
```
