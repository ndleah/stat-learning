<mark class="def">The bootstrap</mark> is a widely applicable and extremely powerful statistical tool that can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method.

<mark class="def">The bootstrap</mark> method is a statistical technique for estimating quantities about a population by averaging estimates from multiple small data samples.

Importantly, samples are constructed by drawing observations from a large data sample one at a time and returning them to the data sample after they have been chosen. This allows a given observation to be included in a given small sample more than once. This approach to sampling is called sampling with replacement.

The process for building one sample can be summarized as follows:

1. Choose the size of the sample. 

2. While the size of the sample is less than the chosen size:

  1. Randomly select an observation from the dataset
  
  2. Add it to the sample
  

```{r bootstrap,echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.cap='A graphical illustration of the bootstrap approach on a small sample containing n=3 observation'}

```

A graphical illustration of the bootstrap approach is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:bootstrap). Each bootstrap data set contains $n$ observations, sampled with replacement from the original data set. Each bootstrap data set is used to obtain an estimate of $\alpha$.
