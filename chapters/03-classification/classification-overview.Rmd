In this chapter, we study approaches for predicting qualitative responses, a process that is known as _**classification**_. 

Predicting a qualitative response for an observation can be referred to as classifying that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category, or class. On the other hand, often the methods used for classification first predict the probability that the observation belongs to each of the categories of a qualitative variable, as the basis for making the classification.

Genrally, we discuss some widely-used classifiers: 
1. _Logistic Regression_
2. _Linear Discriminant Analysis_
3. _Quadratic Dislogistic Regression_
4. _Linear Discriminant Analysis_
5. _Criminant Analysis_
6. _Naive Bayes _
7. _K-nearest neighbors. _

The discussion of logistic regression is used as a jumping-off point for a discussion of _**generalized linear models**_, and in particular, _Poisson regression_.
