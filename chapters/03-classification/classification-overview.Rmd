In this chapter, we study approaches for predicting qualitative responses, a process that is known as <mark class="def">Classification</mark>. 

:::def
Predicting a qualitative response for an observation can be referred to as classifying that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category, or class. On the other hand, often the methods used for classification first predict the probability that the observation belongs to each of the categories of a qualitative variable, as the basis for making the classification.

Generally, we discuss some widely-used classifiers: 

1. [Logistic Regression](#LINEAR-REGRESSION)

2. [Linear Discriminant Analysis](#Linear-Discriminant-Analysis)

3. [Quadratic Dislogistic Regression](#QDA)

4. [Naive Bayes](#bayes)

5. [K-nearest Neighbors](#KNN)


The discussion of logistic regression is used as a jumping-off point for a discussion of <mark class="def">Generalized Linear Models</mark>, and in particular, <mark class="quest">Poisson Regression</mark>.
